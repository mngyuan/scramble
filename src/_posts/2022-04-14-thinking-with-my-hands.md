# Thinking with my hands

_Weekly updates and notes from the studio_

<br />

This past two weeks, I focused mostly on getting a feel for the iterative prototyping methodology. I've long been encouraged to make as part of exploration, both at school, where some projects would build on each other, or at work, where the slogan was famously "Move Fast and Break Things". The hardest part I find is knowing exactly how much of a prototype needs to built, and why.

Almost exactly a year ago, my classmate and good friend Ahad encouraged me to build a cardboard prototype of my [pressure sensitive record player]() to figure out what it is I wanted. It was a poorly thought out, unmeasured mess, and it didn't achieve what possibly could have been its most useful goal: to help me plan to make enough space to fit two speakers, a board to mount them on, a Bela board, an Arduino, a DC motor, and a power supply inside my enclosure.

I learned two key things from this sad mess of cardboard: take play seriously, and to know why you're doing something.

## Take Play Seriously

Often, I feel like I don't take what I'm prototyping seriously - chalk it up to the exploratory and improvisational nature of it sometimes. Accepting that it won't be final, that it won't be my best work, that it's ok to show people sketches are all important parts of lowering the barrier to getting into making, something I sorely need to do. But I've found it really important for myself to, while I'm mentally downgrading the perfectionism in my head, to remind myself that it is still serious work.

Respecting the magic of the "wizard of oz" style of prototype gives it all of its power. Often, it's my own excitement and vision which imbues a simple cardboard prototype with the right "what if" feeling that helps other people understand and ultimately get excited about it. How can other people be excited about my work if I'm not, and how can I be excited about it if I'm not treating it seriously?

<small>Every circle based (and some non-circle based) interaction I could easily get my hands on</small>

It's with this in mind that I got my hands on basically any turn-y, circle-y interface I could think of, in an effort to explore different ways people have already integrated turning into their workflows.

## Know Why You're Doing Something

In good storytelling and in good filmmaking, everything is _motivated_. If something breaks from an established pattern, there's a reason why it's been decided that way. In the same way, when you make something, I thought you ought to know what the motivation is - _why_ you need it to exist.

I know that at the core of what I'm building, I want an interface inspired by vinyl record players - physical, with clear visual and tactile feedback, and immediate and familiar to the touch. I'm drawing a lot of inspiration from DJing, but also Steenbecks and the physical cutting of film (and rolling into reels and loading onto projection systems).

And so - I knew that I needed to test the size, weight, and scale of such a system. The _why_ can be as simple as, I know I need to feel it (but not yet how it feels or why it feels that way).

Similarly, I wanted to put it into peoples hands, to see if the actual size of the object and its accompanying screen made sense at all.

And - I learned to DJ! I couldn't make an interface pulling heavilty from a DJ turntable metaphor without understanding better how it works, and although CDJ / modern DJing is less tactile than vinyl DJing, it was super interesting to feel the approach the interface had to a musical job that I haven't ever had before.

## Getting a bit lost

To be honest, all this working on video editing interfaces has really reignited an old dream of mine, to become a filmmaker. Or maybe it's the fact that I'm now close friends with several image-makers who I consider to be crazy talented in their own rights. Or maybe the continued uncertainty of my future and the slow realization that it's time for me to pick my camera back up again, but in a new way. (Probably all three.)

I watched Tampopo, Licorice Pizza, and Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy (from the Drive My Car director) since the writing of the last post, and I've been meaning to get deeper into the analysis of Drive My Car to really get some numerical insight on what makes the movie tick. That work is still on going, but I've got some fun statistics to share for now:

The longest cut is 4:50s long, long enough to basically match the runtime of a short film. It's also the emotional climax of the film, when the main character and his companion share their deepest, most heartfelt moment with each other.

This length mirrors the longest cut from Act 1 of the film, in Tokyo, a 1:44s cut of the main characters wife dictating a story she's writing to him. It's also another emotional peak (or trough), their last deep connection in the first act.

## Next week

I've sculpted out a light skeleton of what I might be up to next week:

```markdown
[ ] render out what an off the shelf version might look like
[ ] finalize the rotary interaction for a physical prototype
[ ] continue gathering user feedback on using it
[ ] start working on the report
```

It was a tough week (and a half) of working in a space where I'm still finding my footing, but an exciting one, once I look at all of the progress I've been making.
